This Chrome extension adds a transparent overlay at the bottom of any web pages you visit.

When you hover over any link, the overlay shows up and tells you the destination of the link.

When you move away from the link, the overlay will disappear.

You can install the extension by

1) Download the source to your computer
2) In Chrome, go to Window | Extensions
3) Click on the "Developer Mode" link
4) Click on "Load unpacked extension..."
5) Navigate to the directory that you checked out the source code to
6) Click "Open"

...and you're done!
